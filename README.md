In order to make edits to the contents of the homepage, the search bar function, and the advanced search function:

1. Ensure the most recent version of sites.js is in this folder (the simplest thing to do is to download the live version of the file from github).
2. Open the editor and make any desired edits (you may need to manually import it using the button at the top of the editor page).
3. Click to export the new version of sites.js.
4. Test locally if desired.
5. Upload to github (it will automatically replace the older version of sites.js).

This will allow you to edit and re-order entries and to add new sections to the homepage, as well as to edit groups for advanced search functionalities*, and to choose whether sites are included on the homepage, in the search bar search, are selectable in "advanced search", and whether they are selected by default in the advanced search.

*(I haven't yet tested if new tags can be added, or if you simply have to choose from the existing ones).

A couple of bugs in the editor:
1. If a site is included in search but not on the homepage, in order for it to appear on the homepage, you need to delete the entry and re-add it.
2. The master list of all sites is only displayed once you click on a site and scroll down to the bottom on the right.

Next edits and additions:
1. Add a politics section to the advanced search (not included in search bar, and not included in advanced search by default).
2. Add more sites to the politics section.
3. Add more journals and booksellers to the "physical" section.
4. Add a "food" group to the advanced search only, to enable searching ingredients and ideas across multiple trusted recipe sites.
5. Add more libraries inc Ubu, maybe the geocities gif library/cameron's place for fun.
6. Add a section on defunct pdf publishers (gauss, troll thread, lost rocks).

Long term edits:
1. Add Raindrop integration?*
2. Add Obsidian integration? This would introduce problems around access and security.*
3. Add RSS?! (I doubt enough of the sites have RSS to make this worthwhile).
4. Some kind of automated bypass for paywalled sites? This would presumably have to be managed outside of the homepage, but it'd be great to be able to click on paywalled search results and have them just load.

*On second thoughts I'm not sure what the point would be: the homepage/search functionalities solve problems, adding raindrop/obsidian to the homepage doesn't really enable you to do anything you couldn't before.
